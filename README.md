## GeoFS Plugin Manager ##
GeoFS is not the greatest flight simulator in the world , but soon it will be! <br/>
The GeoFS plugin manager allows users to install plugins with jsut a simple click of a button.

### How does it work ###
Users will add a plugin url (The url where the plugin is stored) and the plugin manager will save the plugin script locally and run it each time you enter the game. <br/>
The plugin will also enable you to check for updates , once searching for updates the plugin will check if there are any new versions to the plugins you already have.
